# Summary
### Problem Space
**Cultural barriers** occurs when individuals from different cultures are unable to understand each other’s cultural norms, religious beliefs and daily practices resulting in communication breakdown and inconveniences. Fast cultural adjustments for someone outside one’s culture is crucial to promote better social inclusion in the community. Two important aspects of just about any given culture is its **code of etiquette** and its **use of body language**.

### Concept Statement
This project is to create a platform that allow people to look up a certain etiquette or gesture in one's country to learn more about it and behave appropriately in certain situation. We want to encourage people to be more respectful to different cultural customs and norms while being in a foreign country. What seems normal to one person might deem inappropriate to another person that have different cultural upbringing. For example, doing body languages or hand gestures that may regard as disrespectful to other cultures.  We have online dictionary for slang words and phrases like Urban Dictionary, this could work in a similar way because both slangs and body gestures, they do not have a standard definition. We want to allow people to be comfortable in a social situation with the aid of our application. 

**User scenario:**

An Australian business man went to China for business purposes, had to dine with fellow foreign delegates, he would want to learn how to behave in dining situation, what he should do or should not do to be respectful to others. For example, using chopsticks in a different way have different meanings, e.g. you don’t stick chopsticks straight up in a bowl of rice because it represents offering food to the dead people. 

How would you know this? Imagine if you do this in front of Chinese people. For that reason, we will learn more about people's travel behaviour and how this application will change their behaviour in the future.

### Design Solution
The ideal solution is a web application that allows its user to look up the use of body gesture and code of etiquette in all countries of the world. The core functionality of the website is the crowd-sourcing mechanism where user can engage by sharing their experience in social interaction happening in foreign countries e.g. the meaning of a gesture they wrongly used in the country. Whereas locals can upvote/downvote the post whether the gesture is widely used or acknowledged by the culture. This is inspired by the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ that many platform on the internet are using like Wikipedia and StackExchange. The web application will also presents substantial cultural differences in other countries for user to compare.
